Homework 3: 9.26.18

 Due Monday: 10.1.18
 
 All answers should be written by hand. On physical paper.
 
 All answers should be written as if they were put into Dr. Racket as code.
 
 When I say "program" I mean both the function/expression and accomplanying code.
 
 For example:
 
 ; This is part of the program called Example
 
 ; This is my example expression
 
 (* 7 7)
 
 ; This is my example function
 
 (define (square x) (* x x))
 
 ; This is my example test
 
 (square 7)
 
 ; This is a sample string
 
 "The above number represents the square of 7."
 
 
 1. Write out an example of an expression. (It can be simple)
 2. Write out an example of a function.
 3. In the "program" above, or in a separate function, use:
   3a. A string.
   3b. A number.
   3c. The (read) function.
