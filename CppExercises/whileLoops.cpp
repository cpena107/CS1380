	//challenge 3: Ask user to enter number, say 20.  Then countdown from that number to 1, 20 19 18.. 1 BLASTOFF!

	//challenge 4: Ask user to enter a number n.  compute and print value of 1+2+3 + ... + n.
	//Cool, can you do it with fewer variables?  Try it at home.


	//Challenge 5: Ask user to ennter secret password (it's "blastfoof" ).  If they guess wrong,
	//make keep entering until they guess correctly.
	//For at home:  add a counter so it kicks you out if you guess more than 5 wrong passwords.
